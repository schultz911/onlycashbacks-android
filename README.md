You shouldn't need to add your personal, financial details or spending habits to get the best deals.

**This app collects nothing**

**_AT ALL_**
### ZERO!

## 💖 Privacy-First

- **No Data Hoarding**: The app only stores save states for you to track your offer usage.
- **Manual Sync**: Your data stays in your browser until you hit the "Sync" button. It never pings the cloud in the background unless you log in, and you can delete all your data anytime.
- **No Ads, Ever**: This is a passion project. I'm not here to sell your data, make money, or bug you with ads.

Think of it like a super-powered calculator that remembers your card settings. Nothing more. It's just for you.

- **Also**: Fuck SaveSage and their garbage bullshit.
